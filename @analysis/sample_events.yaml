# Sample Custom Events File (New Architecture)
#
# This file demonstrates how to use the data-driven event system.
# The 'name' of each event must correspond to a definition in 'config.event_definitions.yml'.
# All time values are in MILLISECONDS.

events:

  - time: 60000   # Event at 1 minute (60,000 ms)
    name: edge
    # This event will use all the default parameters for 'edge'
    # as defined in event_definitions.yml.

  - time: 120000  # Event at 2 minutes (120,000 ms)
    name: tranquil
    # This event overrides the default duration to make it shorter.
    params:
      duration_ms: 10000 # 10 seconds, instead of the default 20s

  - time: 180000  # Event at 3 minutes (180,000 ms)
    name: edge
    # This event overrides multiple parameters to create a more intense effect.
    params:
      duration_ms: 30000      # Make it a long 30-second edge
      buzz_freq: 75         # Increase the buzz frequency from 60 to 75 Hz
      volume_boost: 0.05    # Increase the base volume by 5% instead of 3%
      buzz_intensity: 0.5   # Use 50% of the available headroom for the buzz

  - time: 240000 # Event at 4 minutes
    name: tranquil
    # This event creates a faster, wider oscillation
    params:
      osc_freq: 30          # Faster oscillation
      osc_amplitude: 0.7    # Wider swing
      osc_offset: -0.35     # Adjust offset to match new amplitude

Add linked axes feature and alpha/beta axis support

Implements automatic propagation of effects to related funscript axes,
enabling operations on primary axes to also affect their linked counterparts.

Major changes:
- Added linked_axes system: operations on primary axes automatically apply to linked axes
  - volume → volume-prostate
  - alpha → alpha-prostate
  - beta → beta-prostate
- Refactored apply_linear_change() to support multi-axis operations
- Refactored apply_modulation() to support multi-axis operations
- Added _get_target_axes() method to resolve primary + linked axes
- Extracted _apply_linear_change_single() for per-axis implementation
- Extracted _apply_modulation_single() for per-axis implementation

Benefits:
- Simplifies event definitions (no need to duplicate operations for -prostate files)
- Ensures consistent effects across related axes
- Alpha/beta axes now fully functional for MCB-style events
- Backward compatible: linked axes only affected if files exist

Documentation updates:
- Updated FUNDAMENTAL_OPERATIONS.md with comprehensive guide:
  - Documented linked axes behavior
  - Added value normalization section with examples
  - Corrected parameter descriptions to match implementation
  - Added sampling aliasing warnings (avoid 10, 20, 30 Hz frequencies)
  - Included complete examples with alpha/beta axis usage
  - Added best practices and troubleshooting sections

Event definitions:
- Added MCB (Mistress & the Box) event collection to config.event_definitions.yml
- Added Clutch event collection to config.event_definitions.yml
- Changed pulse_frequency normalization max from 200 to 120 Hz

Technical details:
- Linked axes are resolved at operation time based on loaded funscripts
- Operations only apply to linked axes if corresponding .funscript files exist
- No performance impact when linked axes don't exist
- All existing events continue to work without changes
